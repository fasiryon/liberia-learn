# LiberiaLearn Education System Overview

## Purpose
LiberiaLearn is a national digital education platform designed to provide high-quality, offline-first learning to all Liberian children, regardless of location, connectivity, or school resources.

## Core Principles
- Offline-first delivery for all core lessons.
- Equity-focused: accessible on shared devices or low-cost tablets.
- Human-governed AI: supports learning but never replaces curriculum authority.
- National consistency with local visibility and relevance.

## Cognitive Bands
- **Foundation (Grades 1–3):** Literacy, numeracy, curiosity, motor skills.
- **Core (Grades 4–9):** Concept mastery, problem-solving, systems thinking, digital literacy.
- **Specialization (Grades 10–12):** Career readiness, WAEC alignment, technical skills, advanced analysis.

## Additional Principles
- Respect local culture, context, and language.
- Support phased language strategy: English → Liberian English audio → local languages.
- Ensure lessons, labs, and assessments work offline.
